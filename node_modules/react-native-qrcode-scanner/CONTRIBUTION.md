### Active contributor
This project is looking for active contributors, especially those well-versed with Android. 
If you're interested in becoming an active contributor with write access, create an issue titled 'Active contributor', and create a pull request to address a couple of issues. If it goes well, I'd be happy to give write access to merge PRs to master.
