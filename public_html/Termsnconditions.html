					  <p>US Dollar-Backed Digital USD</p>
					</header>
<p>The U.S. Dollar-Backed Stablecoin Terms and Conditions (hereinafter “<strong>USD Stablecoin Agreement</strong>” or “<strong>USD Stablecoin Terms and Conditions”</strong>) constitute an addendum to the General Terms and Conditions for the provisions of and use of (i) the US dollar denominated and backed stablecoin managed by TimesPay known as TimesPay Dollar (“<strong>TSD</strong>”) and (ii) the U.S. dollar denominated and backed stablecoin managed by TimesPay known as (&#8220;TSD&#8221;, &#8220;USD Stablecoins&#8221;). These terms apply to each electronic form or contract executed by users and/or members who use USD Stablecoins, unless expressly stipulated otherwise in the TimesPay Contractual Documentation. To the extent there is a conflict between the USD Stablecoin Agreement and the General Terms and Conditions, the terms of this USD Stablecoin Agreement shall govern and control. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the General Terms and Conditions.</p><ol><li>PRELIMINARY PROVISIONS<ul><li>1.1. Terms and Conditions<ul><li>1.1.1 You must agree to all of the terms of this USD Stablecoin Agreement. If you do not agree to or accept all of the terms of this USD Stablecoin Agreement, please immediately discontinue access to, and use of, all TimesPay services and products. This USD Stablecoin Agreement applies to all users and/or customers of USD Stablecoins, whether as a guest or a registered Member.</li><li>1.1.2. By agreeing to the USD Stablecoin Terms and Conditions, you agree to be bound by the General Terms and Conditions and the rest of the TimesPay Contractual Documentation, as applicable.</li><li>1.1.3. If you are under the age of eighteen (18) or the legal age for entering legally binding contracts under applicable laws, you are not permitted to use any of TimesPay services and products. By continuing to access or use the Site, you indicate that you are (18) years of age or older or have the legal capacity to enter legally binding contracts under applicable laws. Misrepresentation of your age to gain access to any of TimesPay services and products is a breach of this Agreement.</li></ul></li><li>1.2. Definitions</li></ul></li></ol><p>“<strong>Account</strong>” means a Member’s account with TimesPay.</p><p>“<strong>Platform</strong>” means the online software platform operated by TimesPay for the issuance and redemption of USD Stablecoins.</p><ol start="2"><li>DISCLAIMER; RISK FACTORS<ul><li>2.1. The Ethereum blockchain may experience backlogs, higher than normal transaction fees, changes to the network, failure or a fork in the protocol. We do not own or control the Ethereum blockchain and are not responsible for the operation of the Ethereum network and make no guarantees regarding the network’s security, functionality, or availability.</li>
  <li>2.2. Because TSD is ERC20 token, they may be compatible with software or other technology provided by third-party. The Company does not guarantee the security or functionality of any third-party software or technology and is not responsible for any losses of USD Stablecoins due to the failure of third-party software or technology.</li>
  <li>2.3. Please also review the General Terms and Conditions for additional risk factors.</li></ul></li></ol><ol start="3"><li>THE PLATFORM</li></ol><p>The Platform is an online platform that allows Members to acquire USD Stablecoins from the Company for U.S. dollars and redeem USD Stablecoins from the Company for U.S. dollars.</p><ol start="4"><li>USD Stablecoins<ul><li>4.1. USD Stablecoin tokens are not money or legal tender and are not monetary instruments. Once you have USD Stablecoin tokens, you can transfer them, trade them, keep them, use them to pay persons that will accept USD Stablecoins, or redeem them for U.S. dollars from the USD Stablecoin custody account, subject to the limitations below.</li>
        <li>4.2. USD Stablecoin tokens are fully backed by U.S. dollars held by TimesPay, LLC on USD Stablecoin customers&#8217; behalf in segregated custodial accounts with banks or by U.S. Treasury bonds specifically held for the benefit of USD Stablecoin customers, as further described in Section 5 below. The U.S. dollars used to purchase USD Stablecoins are deposited either in insured depository banks or used to purchase U.S. Treasury bonds, as described below, to maintain a one-to-one ratio of each USD Stablecoin to the amount of U.S. dollar deposits or the face amount of US Treasury bonds. For example, if you purchase five TSD with five US dollars, TimesPay will hold those five US dollars in a bank account or in US Treasury bonds to support the five TSD in circulation.</li>
        <li>4.3. The USD Stablecoins are ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum public blockchain. Because of this, USD Stablecoins may be compatible with existing third-party software that supports ERC20 tokens.</li>
        <li>4.4. Only verified Members may purchase USD Stablecoins from us or redeem USD Stablecoins from us. We may also refuse to issue USD Stablecoins to, or redeem USD Stablecoins from, a verified Member in the event of any of any of the circumstances of this Agreement, including, without limitation, where we believe that the issuance or redemption of USD Stablecoins would be contrary to applicable law or would otherwise expose us to legal liability. <strong>Absent a reasonable justification not to redeem USD Stablecoins, and provided that you are a fully verified Member of the Company, your USD Stablecoins are freely redeemable, subject to the redemption minimums described herein.</strong></li>
  </ul>
  </li></ol>

You understand, acknowledge and agree that the underlying operating rules of the Ethereum blockchain may change from time to time in such a way as to result in more than one related version of Ethereum (each instance of any such change, a “<strong>Fork</strong>”).

The Company will evaluate all forks and make a determination, based on a number of factors, to support each USD Stablecoin on one, and only one, of the Forks. The Company will continue to provide Services for, support and hold U.S. dollars against, USD Stablecoins held on the supported Fork only.</li><li>11.2.
